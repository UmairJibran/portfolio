This template is created with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The primary goal of this template is to provide a starting point for developers to build their portfolio and to have a place where they can post their thoughts.

## Technology Used

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** - React framework with hybrid static rendering.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - A utility-first CSS framework.
- **[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)** - To write blog posts.
- **[AntD](https://ant.design/components/overview)** - An enterprise-class UI design language and React UI library.
- **[Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/)** - Simply beautiful open source icons.
- **[Remark HTML](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-html)** - To parse markdown in HTML.
- **[Gray Matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter)** - Parse front-matter from a string or file.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - JavaScript with syntax for types.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, follow these steps:

1. Clone this [repository](https://github.com/umairjibran/portfolio)
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure is organized as follows:

```bash
_blogs
  â””â”€â”€ make-it-your-own.md
public
  â”œâ”€â”€ assets
  â””â”€â”€ robots.txt
src
  â”œâ”€â”€ app
  â”œâ”€â”€ components
  â”œâ”€â”€ data
  â”œâ”€â”€ lib
  â”œâ”€â”€ styles
  â””â”€â”€ types
```

- **\_blogs** - Contains the markdown files for the blog posts.
- **public** - Contains static.
- **src** - Contains the source code.
  - **app** - Contains the pages/layouts.
  - **components** - Contains all the components.
  - **data** - Contains the json files that you can update to add your data.
  - **lib** - Contains utility functions.
  - **styles** - Contains custom CSS styles.
  - **types** - Contains TypeScript types.

## Customization

To customize this template, you can follow these steps:

1. Update the `data` files in the `src/data` directory.
2. Add new blog posts in the `_blogs` directory. (Don't forget to add your cover image in the `public/assets/blogs/[blog-id]/` directory.)
3. Update the `src/styles` directory to add your custom styles.
4. Update the `src/components` directory to add new components.

## Miscellaneous

- To change the favicon, update the `src/app/icon.png` file.
- To update the site metadata, update the `data/meta.json` file.
- I am using [Umami](https://umami.is) for analytics. You can update the `data/umamiAnalytics.json` file with your own `dataWebsiteId`. (it's free to use and open-source.)
- I am using [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) for hosting. You can either create your [static site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/deploy-react?pivots=github) on Azure, and add the environment variables in the `repo > settings > Secrets and variables > actions` or delete the `.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-polite-river-0640ed603.yml` file and update it with your preferred tool.
